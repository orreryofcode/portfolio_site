          <h2>Tekken 7 Iron Fist Companion</h2>
          <div class="works"></div>
          <p>
            A web application for the game Tekken 7 that is designed to provide
            the community of players with useful information such as frame data,
            character notes and notable players of each character. This is a
            passion project that I am building on my own. It is built with React
            and I am using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI to assist in some of the
            styling.

          <h2>House Marketplace - Mock App</h2>
          <div class="works"></div>
          <p>
            An app that allows users to create a profile and post a listing for
            a home/apartment for sale or rent. Users can browse listings posted
            by other users and can edit or delete their created listings. The
            backend solution uses Google's Firebase as this was something that I
            was interested in learning at the time.

            This is a mock website for a food delivery company. The website
            design was created in Figma and the actual website was created using
            HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.

          <h2>Triage - Ticket/Support Desk App</h2>
          <div class="works"></div>
          <p>
            This is a mock web app that was designed with the idea of creating a
            bug tracker and/or help desk ticket application. The design was
            created using Figma and the pages themselves were built using React
            and Redux-Toolkit. The backend solution was built with
            MongoDB/Mongoose and also features basic user verification using
            JSON Web Token and BCrypt.
