          <div class="works"></div>
          <p>
            An app that allows users to create a profile and post a listing for
            a home/apartment for sale or rent. The backend solution uses Google's Firebase as this was something that I
            was interested in learning at the time. This app has full CRUD support for listings created by users.

            This is a mock website for a food delivery company. The website
            design was created in Figma and the actual website was created using

          <div class="works"></div>
          <p>
            This is a mock web app that was designed with the idea of creating a
            bug tracker and/or help desk ticket application. The design was
            created using Figma and the app was built with React and ReduxToolkit. The backend solution was built with
            MongoDB/Mongoose and also features basic user verification using
            JSON Web Token and BCrypt.

          <div class="works"></div>
          <p>
            A web application for the game Tekken 7 that is designed to provide
            the community of players with useful information such as frame data,
            character notes and notable players of each character. This is a passion project that I am currently rebuilding
            as a lot of the data has changed through recent game updates. I am planning on restyling the entirety of the app as well as I plan to reuse much of the existing structure for Tekken 8 and would prefer it to look nice.
